# Command Maker Library

## Overview
The Command Maker Library is a Java library designed to facilitate the creation and management of commands in Minecraft mods. It provides a simple and efficient way to register commands and handle command execution, making it easier for developers to implement custom commands in their mods.

## Features
- Easy command registration
- Command handling and execution
- Support for custom command arguments
- Integration with Minecraft Forge

## Installation
To use the Command Maker Library in your Minecraft mod, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.diamondstar:command-maker-lib:<version>'
}
```

Replace `<version>` with the latest version of the library.

## Usage
To register a command, create an instance of the `DLB` class and use its methods to define your command logic. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```java
DLB commandMaker = new DLB();
commandMaker.registerCommand("example", (context) -> {
    // Command logic here
});
```
